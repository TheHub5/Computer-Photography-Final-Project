# Computer-Photography-Final-Project
Final Project for Computer Photography (CSCI 3240U)

Overview:
Our project selects a target pixel location to find a target colour. Then a replacement colour can be selected to replace the target colour in the image. There is also a sensitivity slider for the replacement colour.

Additionally there are 3 filter effects: the comic book effect, the pixelate effect, and the vintage filter.

Instructions:
 1. Our project initally loads in an image. The user will then input an x an y coordinate and press the "Check Location" button. This will determine the target colour of the pixel at that location and provide a zoomed in image of the location of the target pixel. 
 2. Next the user can select a replacement colour from the "Select Colour" Button. 
 3. Finally the "Replace Colour" button will replace the target colour in the image with the replacement colour. The sensitivity slider can be used to the senstivity of the replacement colour in the image.
